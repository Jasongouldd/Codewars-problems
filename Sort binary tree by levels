Your task is to return the list with elements from tree sorted by levels, which means the root element goes first, then root children (from left to right) are second and third, and so on.

Return empty list if root is None.

Solution:

from collections import deque
# Breadth-first search
def tree_by_levels(node):
    if node is None:
        return []
    
    queue = deque([node])
    result = []
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        result.append(current.value)
        
        if current.left:
            queue.append(current.left)
        
        if current.right:
            queue.append(current.right)
        
    return result
